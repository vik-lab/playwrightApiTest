Playwright JavaScript API Tests
This repository contains JavaScript API tests using Playwright for automated testing of web applications.

Installation
To run the tests, you'll need to install the following packages:
Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)
npm (comes with Node.js)

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the necessary packages by running:
npm install @playwright/test --save-dev

Running Tests
To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:
npx playwright test
This command will execute all the tests located in the tests directory by default. You can customize which tests to run by providing a path or a glob pattern as an argument to the npx playwright test command.

For example, to run a specific test file:
npx playwright test tests/petApiTests.spec.js

Viewing Results
After running the tests, you'll see the test results printed to the console. Playwright provides detailed output including test descriptions, status (pass/fail), and any errors encountered during execution.

Additionally, Playwright generates HTML and JSON reports by default. You can find the reports in the test-results directory. 
Open the HTML report in your browser to view a more detailed summary of the test results.
